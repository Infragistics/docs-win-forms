=== .NET Core 3.1 Support & Limitations

A new environment to use Infragistics controls is now available! As of version 2020.1, our assemblies now have support for the .NET Core 3.1 environment through NuGet.
For some advantages of .NET Core 3.1, see link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-core-3-1[This article on Microsoft's site].

Please note since Microsoft has removed the Context Menu with the release of .NET Core 3.1 we have had to make changes to accommodate this. link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/compatibility/winforms[Documentation on 3.1 Breaking changes]
