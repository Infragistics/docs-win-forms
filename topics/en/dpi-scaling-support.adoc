== DPI Awareness

[[_Ref377393133]]

=== Introduction

Starting with Infragistics for {ProductName} 19.1, system-wide & per-monitor dpi awareness is integrated seemlessly into our most popular controls to ensure your applications are tailored to meet your needs. There is no longer any monitor-related limitations associated with building {ProductName} applications. 

In the past, symptoms such as blurriness and/or fuzziness present in large or small screens, including multiple monitor setups with various dpi and resolutions variations would impact continuity in your end user's experience and cause unwanted consequences.

[[_Requirements]]
=== Requirements

==== Environment

Starting in .NET Framework 4.6 and Windows 10 you can take advantage of high dpi support. Windows 10 high-dpi support is properly implemented starting with creator's Update 1703 and later. Note, older versions of .NET controls may not scale properly.

==== Configuration

Enable per-monitor DPI awareness in the app.config file. Add the following section:

*In XML:*
[source,xml]
----
<System.Windows.Forms.ApplicationConfigurationSection>
  <add key="DpiAwareness" value="PerMonitorV2" />
</System.Windows.Forms.ApplicationConfigurationSection>
----

For more details you may refer to MSDN online:

link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/winforms/high-dpi-support-in-windows-forms[High DPI support in Windows Forms]

The following is an example of what a control looks like dpi-unaware compared to when it is dpi-aware and scaled.

=== How to opt-in or opt-out of DPI Scaling

The `DpiUtilities` class has been added to the Infragistics.Win assembly with an optional property called `MaxInfragisticsDpiAwareness`. This property defaults to DpiUnaware.

[options="header", cols="a,a"]
|====
|Property|Description

|DpiUnaware
|All Infragistics controls across the entire application will be opted out of dpi scaling.

|PerMonitorDpiAware
|All Infragistics controls will scale based on each detected monitor's dpi settings.

|SystemDpiAware
|All Infragistics controls opt into dpi scaling based on the primary screen's dpi settings. 

|====

Configuring `MaxInfragisticsDpiAwareness` in code behind.

*In C#:*

[source,csharp]
----
Infragistics.Win.DpiUtilities.MaxInfragisticsDpiAwareness = Infragistics.Win.InfragisticsDpiAwareness.SystemDpiAware;
----

*In Visual Basic:*

[source,vb]
----
Infragistics.Win.DpiUtilities.MaxInfragisticsDpiAwareness = Infragistics.Win.InfragisticsDpiAwareness.SystemDpiAware
----
