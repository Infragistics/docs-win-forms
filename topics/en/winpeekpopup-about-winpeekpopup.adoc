The WinPeekPopup™ is a Windows Forms component that can display any Windows Forms Control in a stylized popup window.

The peek window features the following parts:

. Content--features the control assigned to the peek window, and displays the majority of the UI that the peek window will convey. The content control is assigned to the
link:{ApiPlatform}win.misc{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.misc.ultrapeekpopup~content.html[Content] property.

* Content property

The `Content` property is the minimum requirement for an link:{ApiPlatform}win.misc{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.misc.ultrapeekpopup.html[UltraPeekPopup] peek window to show, a peek window can be displayed without a caption or caption buttons, but it will not be shown if the Content property is not set.

. Caption--specifies the text displayed at the top of the Peek window. This is done by setting the
link:{ApiPlatform}win.misc{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.misc.ultrapeekpopup~caption.html[Caption]
property.

. Left/Right CaptionButtons--Peek caption buttons can be displayed at the top of the Peek window to provide additional functionality.

and
link:{ApiPlatform}win.misc{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.misc.ultrapeekpopup~captionbuttonsright.html[CaptionButtonsRight]
collections are exposed directly off the `UltraPeekPopup` object. Any
link:{ApiPlatform}win{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawineditors.editorbutton.html[EditorButtons]
added to these collections are displayed at the top of the Peek window. +

The following is an example of adding a button to the left collection:
