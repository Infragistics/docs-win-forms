=== .NET 5.0 Support

A new environment to use Infragistics controls is now available! As of version 2020.2, our assemblies now have support for the .NET 5.0 environment through NuGet. 
NET 5.0 is the next major release of .NET Core following 3.1.

For some advantages of .NET 5.0, see link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/dotnet-five[this article on Microsoft's site].

You can read about configuring your environment to use Infragistics NuGet packages at our link:nuget-feeds.html[NuGet Feed] and link:nuget-packages.html[NuGet Packages] topics.
